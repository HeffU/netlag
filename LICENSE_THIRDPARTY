Oculus VR Rift SDK Software License

Oculus VR, LLC Software Development Kit License Agreement

Copyright © 2014 Oculus VR, LLC. All rights reserved.

The text of this may be found at: http://www.oculusvr.com/licenses/LICENSE-3.2

Human-Readable Summary*:

You are Free to:

Use, modify, and distribute the Oculus VR Rift SDK in source and binary 
form with your applications/software.

With the Following Restrictions:

You can only distribute or re-distribute the source code to LibOVR in 
whole, not in part. 

Modifications to the Oculus VR Rift SDK in source or binary form must 
be shared with Oculus VR.

If your applications cause health and safety issues, you may lose your 
right to use the Oculus VR Rift SDK, including LibOVR.

The Oculus VR Rift SDK may not be used to interface with unapproved commercial 
virtual reality mobile or non-mobile products or hardware.

* - This human-readable Summary is not a license. It is simply a convenient 
reference for understanding the full Oculus VR Rift SDK License Agreement. 
The Summary is written as a user-friendly interface to the full Oculus VR Rift 
SDK License below. This Summary itself has no legal value, and its contents do 
not appear in the actual license.

Full-length Legal Copy:

1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement (the "License"), 
Oculus VR, LLC ("Oculus VR") hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, 
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, sublicenseable copyright license to use, 
reproduce, redistribute (subject to restrictions below), modify, and improve the 
software contained in this Oculus VR Rift Software Development Kit ("RIFT SDK"), 
including, but not limited to, the samples, headers, LibOVR headers, and LibOVR 
source.  This license is subject to the following terms and conditions:

1.1. This license includes the non-exclusive license and right to use (i) the RIFT
SDK to make applications, content, games and demos (collectively and generally 
referred to as "Developer Content") that run on the Oculus VR approved mobile hardware 
and software products ("Oculus Approved Rift Products") and which may incorporate 
the RIFT SDK in whole or in part in binary or object code; and (ii) to use the 
RIFT SDK to create derivative works of the RIFT SDK itself ("RIFT SDK Derivatives"), 
whether in source, binary, or object form, in whole or in part, including third 
party software unless otherwise noted.
  
1.2.  RIFT SDK Derivatives are further defined as source, binary or object code 
derived exclusively from the RIFT SDK by you; provided, however, that RIFT SDK 
Derivatives do not include the Developer Content (engines, utilities, applications, 
content, games or demos) which may be developed using the RIFT SDK.  By way of example 
a mobile application or game or demo that is developed using the RIFT SDK would not 
be a RIFT SDK Derivative , nor would a utility or tool set in a pre-existing game 
engine that is adapted to work with the RIFT SDK be a RIFT SDK Derivative. 
By way of example, but not limitation, a RIFT SDK Derivative is or would be: either (i) 
an adaptation of a utility or piece of code from the RIFT SDK to improve efficiency; 
or (ii) an addition of code or improvement to the RIFT SDK that adds functionality. 

1.3  For the sake of clarification when you use the RIFT SDK (including RIFT SDK 
Derivatives) in or with Developer Content, you retain all rights to your Developer 
Content, and you have no obligations to share or license Developer Content (including 
your source and object code) to Oculus VR or any third parties; provided, however, 
Oculus VR retains all rights to the RIFT SDK and the RIFT SDK Derivatives that may 
be incorporated into your Developer Content.

1.4  You agree to and you will use  the Flash Screen Warning and the Health and 
Safety Warnings (collectively the "Oculus Warnings") and the Oculus VR health and 
safety protocols found in the Oculus Best Practices Guide ("Oculus H&S Protocols"), 
and your use of the Oculus Warnings and the Oculus end user license agreement 
("Oculus EULA") with your Developer Content as provided for in the Oculus Developer 
Center, all of which can be found at the following link:  
https://developer.oculusvr.com/?action=doc.

2. You, the recipient and user of the RIFT SDK, hereby agree and accept that that
Oculus VR shall own all right, title and interest to the intellectual property 
rights, including, but limited to copyright, trademark and patent rights, to any 
RIFT SDK Derivatives that you may create, and you hereby assign any and all such 
rights to such RIFT SDK Derivatives to Oculus VR, subject to the following.

2.1  We hereby grant to you the a fully paid up, no-charge, royalty-free, 
world-wide, in perpetuity, non-exclusive right and license back to use these RIFT 
SDK Derivatives solely in conjunction with the RIFT SDK (or any components of the 
RIFT SDK) and/or Developer Content on Oculus Rift Products as set forth herein.

2.2  Furthermore, for the sake of clarification, Oculus VR and its assignees and 
licensees shall be free to use such RIFT SDK Derivatives without any approval 
from you and without compensation or attribution to you.

2.3  You also agree upon Oculus VR's request to provide the source and binary code 
of any RIFT SDK Derivatives to Oculus VR. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS REQUEST 
IS THE BASIS FOR AUTOMATIC TERMINATION OF THIS LICENSE BY OCULUS VR.

3. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, your license to redistribute 
and sublicense the RIFT SDK and RIFT SDK Derivatives is also expressly made 
subject to the following conditions:

3.1. You may sublicense and redistribute the source, binary, or object code of 
the RIFT SDK in whole or in part by itself for no charge or as part of a for charge 
piece of Developer Content; provided, however, you may only license, sublicense 
or redistribute the source, binary or object code of LibOVR in whole, and you may 
not license, sublicense or redistribute any portion or element of LibOVR separately 
or in part (in either source, binary or object form). If you license, sublicense 
or redistribute RIFT SDK Derivatives in and of themselves (not as a part of a 
piece of Developer Content) then you may only do that solely with and in conjunction 
with either the RIFT SDK or LibOVR. The RIFT SDK (including, but not limited to 
LibOVR), any RIFT SDK Derivatives, and any Developer Content may only be used 
with Oculus Approved Rift Products and may not be used, licensed, or sublicensed 
to interface with mobile software or hardware or other commercial headsets, 
mobile tablets or phones that are not authorized and approved by Oculus VR;

3.2. You must include with all such redistributed or sublicensed RIFT SDK 
or RIFT SDK Derivatives code the following copyright notice: 
"Copyright © 2014 Oculus VR, LLC. All rights reserved," and include the 
list of conditions contained in this Section 3, including the full text of 
the disclaimer in Section 3.6 below;

3.3. Neither the name of Oculus VR, LLC nor the names of Oculus VR, LLC's 
contributors, licensors, employees, or contractors, may be used to endorse or promote 
products derived from this RIFT SDK without specific prior written permission 
of Oculus VR, LLC;

3.4. You must give any other recipients of the RIFT SDK or any elements thereof, 
including LibOVR or RIFT SDK Derivatives, a copy of this License as such recipients, 
licensees or sublicensees may only use the RIFT SDK or any RIFT SDK Derivatives 
or any elements thereof subject to the terms of this Licence and such recipients, 
licensees or sublicensees agreement and acceptance of this License with Oculus VR 
(which will convey all rights to the recipients’ or licensees’ or sublicensees’ 
RIFT SDK Derivatives to Oculus VR),  and you must cause any modified files to 
carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files;

3.5. If the RIFT SDK or a specific element thereof such as LibOVR includes a 
"LICENSE" text file as part of its distribution (the "License Notice"), then 
any RIFT SDK Derivatives that you distribute with the RIFT SDK in whole or in 
part must include a readable copy of such attribution notices as are contained 
within the applicable License Notice file (excluding those notices that do not 
pertain to any part of the RIFT SDK Derivatives), in at least one of the following 
places: within a License Notice text file distributed as part of the RIFT SDK 
Derivatives; within the source form or documentation, if provided along with 
the RIFT SDK Derivatives; or, within a display generated by the RIFT SDK Derivatives, 
if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.  You must also include 
in the License Notice file for all RIFT SDK Derivatives a copy of all notices 
(including any product liability or health and safety notices).  The contents 
of the License Notice file are for informational purposes only and do not modify
the License. You may add your own attribution notices within RIFT SDK Derivatives 
that you distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the License Notice text from 
the RIFT SDK or any part thereof, provided that such additional attribution notices 
cannot be construed as modifying the License.

3.6. THIS RIFT SDK AND ANY COMPONENT THEREOF IS PROVIDED BY OCULUS VR AND 
ITS CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, 
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS 
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL OCULUS VR AS THE 
COPYRIGHT OWNER OR ITS CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, 
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT 
LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, 
OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF 
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING 
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS RIFT 
SDK OR THE RIFT SDK DERIVATIVES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

4. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, 
service marks, or product names of Oculus VR, except as required for reasonable 
and customary use in describing the origin of the RIFT SDK, LibOVR, or any 
element thereof, and reproducing the content of the License Notice file. 
Oculus VR reserves all rights not expressly granted to you under this License.

5. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), 
contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as 
deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall Oculus VR 
or any contributor be liable to you or your licensees or sublicensees for 
damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential 
damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use 
or inability to use the RIFT SDK, LibOVR, any element thereof or any RIFT SDK 
Derivatives (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work 
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial 
damages or losses), even if you or such contributor has been advised of the 
possibility of such damages.

6.  Your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this License in and of 
itself and for all Developer Content created as of March 1, 2014, may be 
evidenced by any of the following: your usage of the RIFT SDK or any element 
thereof, acceptance of the click-through agreement, or opening the packaging 
of the CD-ROM containing the RIFT SDK or any element thereof, including LibOVR.  
As this License is updated for future releases of the RIFT SDK and/or LibOVR, 
you agree to abide by and meet all requirements of future updates of this 
License for those future RIFT SDK releases as evidenced by the same usage of 
the RIFT SDK or any element thereof and the future updates of this License 
will apply for that future Developer Content that may developed for or with 
that future RIFT SDK or any element thereof (i.e., you cannot sidestep out 
of the requirements of future updates of the License by developing against 
an older release of the RIFT SDK or License).
 
7.  Oculus VR reserves the right to terminate this License and all your 
rights hereunder in the event you materially breach this License and fail 
to cure such breach within ten (10) business days after notice of breach 
from Oculus VR.  

8.  Furthermore, Oculus VR also reserves the right to cancel or terminate 
this License for any of the following reasons upon notice to you, subject 
to the appeal process set forth in Section 14 for a wrongful termination: 

	a) Intellectual property infringement by you with Developer Content 
	or RIFT SDK Derivatives created by you that is used with or by the 
	RIFT SDK or any part thereof, or any of the RIFT SDK Derivatives;
	
	b) Developer Content that violates or infringes upon applicable law;
	
	c) Health and safety issues associated with your Developer Content;
	
	d) Failure to comply with or use properly the Oculus Warnings, 
	Oculus H&S Protocols, or Oculus EULA; 
	
	e) Use of the RIFT SDK, RIFT SDK Derivatives or LibOVR with a 
	commercial product other than an Oculus Approved Product; and
	
	f) Failure to provide required notices or deliver source code 
	and/or binary of RIFT SDK Derivatives as set forth above.
	
If you believe that you have been wrongfully terminated under this Section 8 
with respect to material breach or with respect to these above conditions, 
you have the right to appeal the termination of this License under Section 14. 

9.  This License may be amended by Oculus VR on a prospective basis, and your 
usage of the License after such amendments or changes signifies your consent 
to and acceptance of any such amendments or changes on a going forward basis.

10.   In the event any provision of this License is determined to be invalid, 
prohibited or unenforceable by a court or other body of competent jurisdiction, 
this License shall be construed as if such invalid, prohibited or unenforceable 
provision has been more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or 
unenforceable.  

11.   You may not assign any rights or obligations under this License without 
the advance written consent of Oculus VR, which may be withheld in its sole 
discretion.  Oculus VR may assign its rights or obligations under this License 
in its sole discretion.

12.   Failure of either party at any time to enforce any of the provisions of 
this License will not be construed as a waiver of such provisions or in any way 
affect the validity of this License or parts thereof.

13.   Your remedies under this License shall be limited to the right to collect 
money damages, if any, and you hereby waive your right to injunctive or other 
equitable relief.

14.   This License shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, 
without giving effect to choice of law principles.  All disputes relating to 
this License shall be resolved by binding non-appearance-based arbitration 
before a neutral arbitrator in Orange County, California.  If your License 
has been terminated hereunder by Oculus, you may appeal your termination 
through this arbitration process on an expedited basis with an arbitration 
within thirty days of your giving Oculus VR notice of the appeal.  The 
arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules and procedures 
of JAMS then in effect, and the judgment of the arbitrator shall be final 
and capable of entry in any court of competent jurisdiction.  You agree 
to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Orange 
County, California in connection with any entrance of an arbitrator’s judgment 
or decision or any dispute with respect to the arbitration process or procedure 
or Oculus VR’s exercise of its equitable rights or remedies.

    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *

8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

such modified license differs from this License).
